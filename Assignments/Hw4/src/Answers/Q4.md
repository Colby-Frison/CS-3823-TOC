# Question 4
## (i) Advances in mathematics since 5,000 B.C. that allowed people to express bigger numbers:

1. **Place-value numeral systems (e.g., Babylonian base-60 system, Hindu–Arabic decimal system)**:  
   These systems allowed for the concise representation of large numbers using a limited set of symbols, a major improvement over additive systems like Roman numerals.

2. **Exponentiation**:  
   This allowed numbers to grow multiplicatively rather than additively. For example, \( 10^3 \) is much larger than \( 10 + 10 + 10 \).

3. **Stacked exponentials (tetration)**:  
   As discussed by Aaronson, stacking exponentials (e.g., \( 9^{9^{9}} \)) allows for numbers far larger than simple exponentiation.

4. **Ackermann function**:  
   Aaronson describes this as a systematic way to generate ever-larger numbers through a hierarchy of operations (addition, multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, etc.).

5. **Busy Beaver function**:  
   This is a non-computable function from computability theory that grows faster than any computable function, including the Ackermann function.

## (ii) Would Aaronson say Turing machines are important even without real-world impact?

**Yes**.  
Aaronson argues that Turing machines are fundamentally important not only for their practical applications but also for their role in defining the limits of computation and enabling the definition of extremely large numbers (e.g., via the Busy Beaver function). Even without real-world impact, Turing machines would still be significant for:

- Formalizing the notion of *computability*,
- Providing a foundation for the theory of computation,
- Enabling the definition of non-computable functions like the Busy Beaver,
- Serving as a tool for exploring the boundaries of mathematical expressibility.

Aaronson emphasizes that the *conceptual power* of Turing machines allows us to name numbers so large that they exceed anything expressible with earlier paradigms, regardless of whether those machines are physically built or widely used.

## Group mate's answer
### (i)
Exponents, Ackermann sequence, and Busy Beaver numbers

### (ii)
Aaronson uses the hypothetical of explaining Turing machines to Archimedes, when computers were non existent. "Big numbers have a way of imbuing abstract notions with reality." He claims that the definition of science is "reason’s attempt to compensate for our inability to perceive big numbers." Turing machines allow us to rationalize larger numbers than ever before, thus being important to all of science, not just computer science.
