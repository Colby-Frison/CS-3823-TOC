# Question 2

The language
$L_{1} = \{\, w \in \{0,1,2,3\}^* \mid \#_0(w) = \#_1(w) \text{ and } \#_2(w) = \#_3(w) \,\}$
is **not** context-free. We argue by contradiction using the pumping lemma for context-free languages.

Assume that $L_{1}$ were context-free, and let $p$ be the pumping length promised by the lemma. Consider the string
$w = 0^{p} 2^{p} 1^{p} 3^{p}$,
which clearly lies in $L_{1}$. The pumping lemma tells us that we can write $w = uvxyz$ with $|vxy| \leq p$, $|vy| \geq 1$, and that all strings $uv^{i}xy^{i}z$ must remain in $L_{1}$.

Because $|vxy| \leq p$, the substring $vxy$ lives entirely within one of the four uniform blocks $0^p, 2^p, 1^p, 3^p$, or it straddles exactly one adjacent boundary between these blocks. In every case, pumping contradicts membership in $L_{1}$:

- If $v$ and $y$ contain only one symbol (all $0s$, all $2s$, etc.), pumping up or down changes that symbol’s count while leaving at least one of its required partner counts untouched (for example, increasing the number of $0s$ without changing the number of $1s$), so the pumped string exits $L_{1}$.
- If $vxy$ straddles the boundary between two blocks (say the $0/2$ boundary), then pumping alters both symbols in the boundary but still leaves the symbols farther to the right unchanged. For instance, pumping across the $0/2$ boundary changes the number of $0s$ without changing the number of $1s$, breaking the requirement $\#_{0} = \#_{1}$. Similar contradictions occur for the $2/1$ and $1/3$ boundaries.

Thus no decomposition $uvxyz$ can satisfy the pumping lemma conditions, contradicting our assumption that $L_{1}$ is context-free. Therefore $L_{1}$ is not a context-free language.
