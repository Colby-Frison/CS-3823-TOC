# What will be on the final

## Material

The material for the final exam will be cumulative. Regarding the book by Sipser, we deal with the material presented in the following sections (also showing correspondence to our slides next to the sections):
- 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 (slide deck: ToC_00_Introduction.pdf)
- 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 (slide deck: ToC_01_Regular_Languages.pdf)
- 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 (slide deck: ToC_02_CFLs.pdf)
- 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 (slide deck: ToC_03_TMs.pdf)
- 4.1, 4.2 (slide deck: ToC_04_Decidability.pdf)
- 5.1, 5.2 (slide deck: ToC_05_Reducibility.pdf; slides 1-13)
    - From the Post Correspondence Problem you only need to know what the problem is and that it is undecidable.
- 7.1 , 7.2 and 7.3 (slide deck: ToC_06_Time_Complexity.pdf; slides 1-9, 19-21, 28-31, 42-44, 46-48). 
    - From Section 7.1 the most important part is the discussion on asymptotic complexity: Big-Oh, little-Oh, Big-Omega, little-Omega, Theta. 
    - From Sections 7.2 and 7.3 you basically want to know:
        - what the classes P and NP are and what does it mean for a language to belong to such a complexity class; the relevant definitions are 7.12, 7.18, 7.19, and
        - what the P vs NP question is about; e.g., see the discussion in pages 297-298 of the book at the end of Section 7.3.

The final exam will have flavor similar to the midterm exams.  Exercises will be given to you and you will be expected to provide solutions for the questions asked.  Please make sure that you know what a configuration of a Turing machine is!  On top of that the exam will have true or false, or multiple choice, questions.

The slides, the handout on Turing machines that I have provided you, and the homework problems that we had as assignments throughout the semester should be good sources while you review the material.  (In fact, for the largest part, I want to believe that they do a good job to cover the material entirely.)  Please note that the slides may contain material that is not described above (for example, Rice's theorem).  Such material will not be asked in the final, so, please read what is included in the above sections.  In order to help you, in the last two bullets above I mention what the relevant slides are from the last two slide decks, since not the entire slide decks are relevant.  If you have any other questions, by all means, please ask.

More Proposed Questions and Candidate Answers
On Canvas, under Files > Proposed Questions, there is a file with proposed questions and answers that was compiled last year in the same class by the TAs.  These questions and answers were given by students like you who were taking the class last year.  I have not checked the correctness of the provided proofs.  However, this is material that you can use to get inspiration for additional questions and potential answers to such questions.  If you disagree with some "solution", please bring it to my attention.  It could very well be the case that the proposed "solution" that some student gave in 2024 was in fact wrong.  We can fix this together.  Also, in Sipser's book there are worked out examples in various sections, as well as solutions to some of the exercises at the end of every chapter.  You can use all this information to practice some more.

## Cheat Sheet

You are allowed to bring a 1-page cheat sheet in the final exam.  Only one of the two sides of the page can be used.

Permissible size: up to letter-paper size.

You are not allowed to use any electronic means (iPads, computers, scanners, electronic resizing, etc) or stitch several pieces together.  Anyone who violates this rule will receive a 0.

Exam Rules
- The exams will be closed-books written exams.
- You are allowed to bring one page of hand-written notes for the exam (with the constraints explained above for such a cheat-sheet).
- You cannot use any electronic devices during the exam.
- Cell phones and other electronic devices should also be out-of-sight even if you are not using them or if their screens are off.
- If you do not abide with the above, or you are found to be holding a cell phone, you will receive a zero.

Good luck everyone!

Sincerely, 
Dimitris Diochnos
